    about:
      "This is an app for job listings where users can post and/or apply for odd jobs locally such as gardening and cleaning. ",
    description: `I recently built this app as a team, consisting of 6 developers, as part of our 4-week project for our coding bootcamp. Adopting AGILE methodology, we worked asynchronously in sub teams, similar to a real work environment, with daily standups and retrospectives.
    For this project, I initially worked on the development of RESTful API for creating and listing jobs using Express, and used PostgreSQL to interact with database hosted at Heroku. I then worked on the frontend of the project with TypeScript using Next.js, working on a feature at a time using ticketing system.`,

    about:
      "This hangman game was my first major personal project. I worked on this duing the christmas week break of my programming bootcamp.",
    description: ` This game as been created using javascript, html and styled using css.
    Learnings: Working on this project helped me solidify and improve my knowledge and understanding of javascript, html and css. I had to write more complex functions than I had previously worked on. After breaking down the problems, I researched and searched for solutions that I could not slove using my prior programming knowledge.
    
    Please have a go at the game in your computer (not mobile responsive yet).`,
