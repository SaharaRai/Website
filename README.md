# Decisions

As this is a very simple project, it would not massively benefit from using tech tools such as typescripts, next.js and styled components which I have used for my School of Code 4 week project. However, I decided use these tech tools to consolidate my understanding of these tech tools, and set up a project with these tools myself and deploy it.
